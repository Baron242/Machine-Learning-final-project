# Machine-Learning-final-project

This was my final project for my Machine Learning course at Ontario Tech University.

ML_Final_Project.ipynb, sentiment_analysis_app.py and ML_Final_Project_Presentation_Baron_Schitka_100788848.pdf are the three files you will want to look at the most.

ML_Final_Project.ipynb - Is the creation/training of the sentiment analysis model.

sentiment_analysis_app.py - Is a sentiment analysis application using the model.

ML_Final_Project_Presentation_Baron_Schitka_100788848.pdf - Is a presentation on the project. A video version can be found at [https://youtu.be/2_5IMczBYAE](https://youtu.be/2_5IMczBYAE).

# Different approaches for sentiment analysis on the IMDB review dataset.

Learning Problem: A comparative study of different machine learning approaches. I will be comparing RNN, LSTM and CNN on a common dataset. That dataset is an IMDB review dataset.
