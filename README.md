# Machine-Learning-final-project

This was my final project for my Machine Learning course at Ontario Tech University.

# Different approaches for sentiment analysis on the IMDB review dataset.

Learning Problem: A comparative study of different machine learning approaches. I will be comparing RNN, LSTM and CNN on a common dataset. That dataset is an IMDB review dataset.
