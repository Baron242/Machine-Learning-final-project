# Machine-Learning-final-project

This was my final project for my Machine Learning course at Ontario Tech University.

ML_Final_Project.ipynb and sentiment_analysis_app.py are the two files you will want to look at the most.

ML_Final_Project.ipynb - Is the creation/training of the sentiment analysis model.
sentiment_analysis_app.py - Is a sentiment analysis application using the model.

# Different approaches for sentiment analysis on the IMDB review dataset.

Learning Problem: A comparative study of different machine learning approaches. I will be comparing RNN, LSTM and CNN on a common dataset. That dataset is an IMDB review dataset.
